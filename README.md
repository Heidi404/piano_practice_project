# Piano

## This repository is meant as a portfolio of sorts.

## Properties

The program contains a staff and a keyboard.  When a key is clicked, a sound is played and the corresponding note is drawn on the staff. 
The keyboard keys change color when clicked and the name of the key appears next to the keyboard. There are four different types of notes:
quarter note, half note, 3/4 note and a whole note. The length is determined by the length of the click. 

## Note

The image and sound files are only functional on a local pc.
